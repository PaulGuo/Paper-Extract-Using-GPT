      "\n",
      "2. Model Architecture: The Transformer follows an encoder-decoder structure using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder. The architecture is shown in Figure 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Encoder and Decoder Stacks: The encoder and decoder are composed of a stack of identical layers, each with two or three sub-layers. The sub-layers include multi-head self-attention and position-wise fully connected feed-forward networks. Residual connections and layer normalization are employed to facilitate these sub-layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Attention: Attention function is described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the output is computed as a weighted sum of the values. The compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key determines the weight assigned to each value. Scaled Dot-Product Attention is explained as an example of attention function.\n",

      "Section 2: Multi-Head Attention\n",
      "Summary: This section introduces the \"Multi-Head Attention\" mechanism, which linearly projects queries, keys, and values with different learned projections and performs attention functions in parallel.
